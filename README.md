Snippets for sublime text 2.

These started out as some snippets i found on the web for AS3 (can't recall the source, sorry!).

I've since tweaked them a bit over the years, and I've added similar patterns for use in c# to speed up Unity development.  

I hope you find these as useful as I have 8)

Not sure about Windows install, but on a mac, you can plop them into: 
~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2

Enjoy!
